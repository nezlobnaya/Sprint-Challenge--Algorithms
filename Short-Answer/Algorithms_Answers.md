#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
    The time complexity for a = 0 is O(1), since it's simply an assignment operator. The while loop has time complexity O(n)Over all, the result of the input increases as a constant of the input.


b) O(n^2)
 We have entered two for loops that are both n based. The performance is the square of the input data.


c) O(n) 
 It goes down by 1 every time so it will reach n in the same number of runs. Steps required increase with the number of inputs.
